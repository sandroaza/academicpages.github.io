{% include base_path %}

I studied theoretical physics at the University of Trieste (Italy), where I wrote a thesis on quantum computation.

After some fellowships I moved to Padova (Italy), where in 2007 I earned my PhD in physics. During the PhD, some open fundamental questions in biology and ecology fascinated me, so I decided to start studying the temporal evolution of species-rich ecosystems.

In 2007 I moved to Princeton (USA), where I was research associate and I studied macroecological patterns on river topologies as well as spreading of diseases.

In 2009 I moved to the University of Leeds (UK) as a research fellow. Here I developed mathematical methods to upscale and downscale biodiversity information and studied stochastic partial differential equations of biological interest.

Since 2012 I have been a lecturer in applied mathematics in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds.

More recently, in 2016 I have been invited as a visiting fellow of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge) in the programme "Stochastic Dynamical Systems in Biology: Numerical Methods and Applications". Here are some of the most interesting and intriguing seminars.
